# Restaurant-Review-Analysis

1. Performed NLP sentiment analysis on Kaggle restaurant review dataset.
2. Applied data preprocessing and stemming/lemmatization techniques.
3. Designed a robust pipeline with vectorization models.
4. I tested two approaches to build and evaluate a machine learning model. First, I used a Support Vector Machine (SVC) model directly with vectorized features, which achieved an accuracy of 73%. In comparison, when I employed a pipeline combining CountVectorizer and SVC, the accuracy improved to 79%. This demonstrates that integrating feature extraction and classification into a single pipeline yielded better performance, leading to an overall model accuracy of 79%.
